# Database Project

**Project Summary**

1. **Design Database Schema**: Begin by designing the database schema, starting with an E/R diagram and converting it into a relational schema. Validate the design using sample data, ensure data integrity, and eliminate redundancies.

2. **Create Database Tables in MySQL**: After schema validation, prepare an SQL script ("createdb.sql") to create a MySQL database named "ResultTracker." This script includes commands for building tables, defining primary and foreign keys, and maintaining data relationships.

3. **Insert Data to the Database through JDBC**: Implement Java programs to parse CSV files and insert data into the database. You have two options: create separate Java files for each table or use a single "Insert.java" program to parse multiple files.

4. **SQL Queries on the Database**: Write SQL queries to extract valuable information from the database. Perform tasks such as retrieving player details, finding tournaments with specific prize amounts, and identifying high-scoring players. Prepare and submit these queries in separate files (q1.sql to q6.sql).

5. **Query the Database using JDBC**: Develop a Java program called "FinalProjectQuery.java" to run custom queries on the database. This program allows users to interact with the stored data and displays the results conveniently.

By following these steps, you can effectively design a database, populate it with relevant data, execute SQL queries, and create a Java program for tailored database interaction. This project caters to those interested in esports data management, database design, and SQL query execution.
